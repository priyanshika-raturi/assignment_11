        "In probability theory, a **random variable** is one of the most fundamental concepts used to describe and analyze uncertain events. A random variable can be defined as a **function that assigns a real numerical value to each possible outcome of a random experiment**. Instead of working with the outcomes directly—which may be words, events, or complex results—random variables allow us to convert these outcomes into numbers so that they can be studied mathematically. This numerical representation makes it possible to apply statistical tools, compute probabilities, find averages, variances, and perform further data analysis.\n",
